I also own and work out of my own tattoo shop , called Lotus Tattoo in Hemet, California for over 13 years. \n\nInstagram: @jamesmullintattoos","website":"","store_url":"","featured":false,"booth":"Tattoo Pavilion","global_categories":[{"id":"13359","name":"Exhibitor","color":""}],"tags":[{"id":"3166","tag":"Tattoo Pavilion"}],"image":{"big":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/big\/33\/33\/74\/57f11a55-2d89-49dd-af34-3174f156f9a6.png","med":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/med\/33\/33\/74\/57f11a55-2d89-49dd-af34-3174f156f9a6.png","small":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/small\/33\/33\/74\/57f11a55-2d89-49dd-af34-3174f156f9a6.png","thumb":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/thumb\/33\/33\/74\/57f11a55-2d89-49dd-af34-3174f156f9a6.png"},"show_specials":false,"exclusives":false,"artist":true,"specials":[{"id":"40849","title":"James Mullin 1","description":"","price":null,"link":"","image":{"big":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/big\/71\/32\/69\/ec9437a2-6e60-42a5-a491-bd3dbee07548.jpeg","med":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/med\/71\/32\/69\/ec9437a2-6e60-42a5-a491-bd3dbee07548.jpeg","small":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/small\/71\/32\/69\/ec9437a2-6e60-42a5-a491-bd3dbee07548.jpeg","thumb":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/app.growtix.com\/media\/thumb\/71\/32\/69\/ec9437a2-6e60-42a5-a491-bd3dbee07548.jpeg"}}]},{"id":"542684","company":"Jason Palmer Art","first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Palmer","description":"","website":"","store_url":null,"featured":false,"booth":"2249","global_categories":[{"id":"13359","name":"Exhibitor","color":""}],"tags":[],"image":[],"show_specials":false,"exclusives":true,"artist":false},{"id":"542724","company":"JAZWARES, Inc.","first_name":"Lorelei","last_name":"Duterte","description":"","website":"","store_url":null,"featured":false,"booth":"2804","global_categories":[{"id":"13359","name":"Exhibitor","color":""}],"tags":[],"image":[],"show_specials":false,"exclusives":true,"artist":false},{"id":"542639","company":"Jeff's Collectible Empire","first_name":"Jeff","last_name":"Jacob","description":"","website":"","store_url":null,"featured":false,"booth":"1458","global_categories":[{"id":"13359","name":"Exhibitor","color":""}],"tags":[],"image":[],"show_specials":false,"exclusives":true,"artist":false},{"id":"542642","company":"Jerry Vanderstelt","first_name":"Jerry","last_name":"Vanderstelt","description":"Jerry Vanderstelt from VanderStelt Studio welcomes all Star Wars fans to enjoy the show, with all it's various attractions from the Star Wars Universe, as well as Star Wars Art!

As for the Fine Art Paper and Canvas giclees, we will be offering \"A Clan of Two\", \"Endor Chase\", \"Dead or Alive\", \"The Mercenary\" as well as \"Pursuit of  the Ark\" from Raiders of the Lost Ark. We also will be offering \"Premonitions\" featuring Princess Leia from last year's online Star Wars Celebration Art Show, available while they last. We only have around 60 of these! Get here fast as these will be gone quick! We also have a few remaining print editions from past Celebration Art Shows, so stop by at BOOTH 1537 and say hello! My daughter Adrianna Vanderstelt will be featuring her official Art Print for the show titled, \"A Friend\", which features a heart-felt moment with Grogu and R2-D2.
